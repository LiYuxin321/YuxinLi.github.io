I am a Ph.D. student at Xidian University, supervised by Prof. [Bo Chen](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/bchen/). My research focuses primarily on statistical machine learning, time series analysis, diffusion models, and related tasks. I also collaborate closely with Prof. [Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io) from The University of Texas at Austin.

Research Interests

Welcome to my academic page!

I am a Ph.D. student at Xidian University, supervised by Prof. [Bo Chen](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/bchen/). My research focuses primarily on statistical machine learning, time series analysis, diffusion models, and related tasks. I also collaborate closely with Prof. [Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io) from The University of Texas at Austin.

Research Interests
======
* **Multivariate time series analysis**:  Tackling anomaly detection, probability prediction, and other challenges associated with high-dimensional non-stationary time series data.
* **Image anomaly detection**: Addressing anomaly detection problems for images in industrial settings.
* **Optimal transport theory**: Conditional transport, Embedding methods, Concept learning.
* **Bayesian statistics**: Deep generative model, Variational inference, Knowledge representation.

News
